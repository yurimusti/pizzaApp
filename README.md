* Using React Hooks
* Using React-saga to solution a side-effects and implements new features in future, for example: Login, Authentication, etc
* Using React-router to router application
* Using Flex in create layout
* Using Lottie to implements a animations
* Using SVG to manipulate images (SVG IS AWESOME !)

### NodeJS
* Using a simple Express application to return all products for React Application.

### Docker
* Using docker-compose to manipulate various systems.

### Test
* Because of the short time, I did not implement any tests. 
But if I had time, I would use regression testing using Jest and Enzyme and methodology as TDD



Any questions, I am available.
